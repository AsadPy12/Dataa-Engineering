<b> Project Title:</b> End-to-End Data Analysis and Visualization using Kaggle API, Pandas, and SQL

<b> Overview:</b> In this comprehensive data analysis project, I leveraged the Kaggle API to retrieve a dataset and performed an in-depth analysis using Python, Pandas, and SQL. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover valuable insights and answer complex business questions.

<b> Dataset:</b> The dataset used in this project was retrieved from the Kaggle API and consisted of Retail Orders File in which sales and price list with discount percent are given. 

<b> Data Cleaning and Preparation:</b>  Using Pandas, I cleaned and prepared the dataset by:

- Handling missing values and outliers
- Removing unnecessary columns and rows
- Renaming and formatting columns for better readability
- Adding new columns to facilitate analysis
- Dropping redundant columns

<b> Data Analysis:</b> After preparing the data, I performed various analyses to answer the following business questions:

1. <b>Top 10 Highest Revenue-Generating Products:</b>  Identified the top 10 products with the highest revenue using SQL queries.

2. <b>Top 5 Highest Selling Products in Each Region:</b> Determined the top 5 selling products in each region using SQL queries and data visualization techniques.

3. <b>Month-over-Month Growth Comparison:</b> Compared sales growth between 2022 and 2023 on a month-over-month basis, highlighting trends and patterns.

4. <b>Highest Sales by Category and Month:</b> Identified the month with the highest sales for each category using SQL queries and data visualization.

5. <b>Highest Growth by Profit in 2023:</b> Determined the subcategory with the highest growth in profit in 2023 compared to 2022 using SQL queries and data visualization.

<b> Tools and Technologies:</b> 

- Kaggle API for dataset retrieval
- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas for data cleaning and preparation
- SQL for data querying and analysis

<b> Key Takeaways:</b> This project demonstrated my ability to:

- Work with large datasets and perform end-to-end data analysis
- Clean and prepare data for analysis using Pandas
- Write efficient SQL queries to extract insights
- Visualize complex data to communicate findings effectively
- Answer complex business questions using data-driven approaches
